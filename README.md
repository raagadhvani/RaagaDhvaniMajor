# Raaga Dhvani

Raaga Dhvani is a web-based application that explores the intersection of Indian classical music and cutting-edge deep learning algorithms. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this system generates Carnatic music sequences within specific Raagas (melodic frameworks). It also provides a music tutor to assess a person's note playing abilities.

## Description

This study presents a novel system designed to seamlessly integrate Indian classical music's rich heritage with advanced deep learning techniques. The application enables users to upload music samples, accurately identifies the underlying Raaga in the input, and subsequently generates musical notes for continuation using LSTM models.
